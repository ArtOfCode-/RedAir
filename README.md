# RedAir
*Bukkit wireless redstone plugin*

RedAir provides wireless redstone. Sounds familiar? Sure, there are other plugins that do that. 
But the great advantage this one has over the others is its simplicity - 
two commands and you have a wireless redstone connection. It's easy to understand, easy to operate, 
and comes fully fleshed out with all the permissions you need to have complete control over who can do what.

## Features
- Simple, easy to manage connections
- Writes data to disk so you don't lose it on reloads or restarts
- Permissions are included with the plugin

## Installation
RedAir is easy to install. Download, drop into your /plugins folder, reload, and you're off. 
The plugin will generate all the data it needs by itself without needing you to create a thing.

## Commands/Permissions
There is one command off which all others stem: /redair. 
Running this alone will show a help screen containing all the other commands. Here's a list:

- **`/redair help`** - shows the help screen  
  Permission: `redair.use`
- **`/redair start`** - starts making a new wireless connection
Permission: `redair.create`
- **`/redair end`** - finishes the wireless connection
Permission: `redair.create`
- **`/redair remove`** - removes an existing connection

## Planned Updates
Bugs and known caveats are always top of the priority list to fix up. 
For an up-to-date list of these, see the Tickets page and Known Caveats section of the download page. 
Other than that, I'll add features as I think of them; feel free to suggest.
